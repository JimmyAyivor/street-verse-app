      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Who Can Use StreetVerse</h2>
      <p>We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the StreetVerse community.</p>

      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">How You Can't Use StreetVerse</h2>
      <p>Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
      <br></br>
        <li>You don't have to disclose your identity on StreetVerse, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.  </li>

        <li>You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights. </li>

        If you provide the images of the other people, then you must have the right to use them and provide them for our usage. You take full responsibility for any claims that may arise from a person or people that appear in any photo(s) that you used and provided for our usage.</p>
        <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Permissions You Give to Us</h2>

You can end this license anytime by providing the written notice to orders@StreetVerse.com</li>
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">SECTION 3 - MARKETPLACE TERMS</h2>
    <p>Products or services may be available online through the Service. They may have limited quantities and are subject to return or exchange only according to our Refund Policy.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Acquiring our Products</h2>
    <p>You can acquire our Products through our Service in several ways:
        <li>(i) by purchasing individual Products from us on our marketplace (the “Marketplace”);</li>
        <li>(b) by purchasing Products from other users through our Marketplace; or</li>
        <li>(c) by being gifted or transferred our Products by another user or as part of a promotion by us. </li>
        </p><br></br>
      <p>If you buy an individual Product from another user in the Marketplace, you will know the exact Product that you are purchasing. We strongly encourage you not to purchase our Products anywhere other than our Marketplace. If you decide to purchase our Products in any other way or through any other channels, you understand that such purchases will be entirely at your own risk.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Characteristics of our Products</h2>
      <p>Looks are digital fashions items or outfits which can be applied to your pictures via augmented reality technology. Some Looks may be purchased with an associated NFT. Each NFT has a defined set of attributes, including utilities and scarcity, which help determine the value of the NFT. We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors and images of our Products that appear on the Service. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor or mobile devices display of any color will be accurate. </p>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Reservation of Rights with Respect to Our Products</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our Products or services to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any Products or services that we offer. All descriptions of Products or Product pricing are subject to change at any time without notice, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any Product at any time. Any offer for any Product or service made on this site is void where prohibited. We do not warrant that the quality of any Products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the Service will be corrected. </p>
      
      <p>WE DO NOT SHIP PRODUCTS. YOUR PURCHASE IS DIGITAL ONLY. A PHYSICAL ITEM WILL NOT ARRIVE TO YOU AFTER YOUR PURCHASE - OUR PRODUCTS EXIST ONLY DIGITALLY. </p>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">SECTION 4 - ASSUMPTION OF RISK </h2>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Value of NFTs</h2>
      <p>The prices of NFTs are extremely volatile and subjective and NFTs have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other NFTs could materially and adversely affect the value of your NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. Each NFT has no inherent or intrinsic value. We cannot guarantee that any NFTs purchased will retain their original value, as the value of collectibles is inherently subjective and factors occurring outside of our Marketplace may materially impact the value and desirability of any particular NFT.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Tax Calculations </h2>
      <p>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Product-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions in the Marketplace.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Use of Blockchain</h2>
      <p>The Service does not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because the NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Services supporting blockchain network, the Flow Network. Any transfer of NFTs must occurs within the supporting blockchain network, and not on the Service.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Inherent Risks with NFTs</h2>
      <p>There are risks associated with using purchasing NFTs, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Flow Network, however caused.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">Regulatory Uncertainty </h2>
      <p>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and NFT is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the our Marketplace, and therefore the potential utility or value of your NFTs.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">SECTION 5 - APP TERMS</h2>

These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and we agree that any Claim (as defined below) that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of New York, and that [Los Angeles, New York] is the proper and exclusive forum for any such proceedings.</li>

      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">SECTION 20 - ARBITRATION AGREEMENT </h2>
      <p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE YOU AND StreetVerse TO ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>This section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and StreetVerse that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly:
        <li>(a) this Terms of Service, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; </li>
        <li>(b) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; </li>
        <li>(c) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or </li>
        <li>(d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with StreetVerse, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to these Terms.</li>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>You can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing StreetVerse us on our <a href="/contact" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline transition duration-300 ease-in-out mb-4">
Contact Page</a> with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us on our <a href="/contact" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-700 transition duration-300 ease-in-out mb-4">
Contact Page</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that StreetVerse has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. AAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or New York, unless you and StreetVerse agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes:
        <li>(i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; </li>
        <li>(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and </li>
        <li>(iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and StreetVerse agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether any provision of this Terms of Service is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</li>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing StreetVerse from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of Service Content, data security, or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting Claims in small claims court, if your Claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other Claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any Claim regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h2 class="text-left text-blueGray-700 underline font-bold text-xl ... ">SECTION 21 - CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER </h2>
      <p>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSONS CLAIMS. YOU AND StreetVerse AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER StreetVerse USERS. YOU AND StreetVerse FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND StreetVerse ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.</p>
